Hey, Guys My name is Shipra Verma, I am a sophmore in Electronics Engineering at Harcourt Butler Technical University Kanpur. Currently i am working on my projects involving Django. I like collaborating projects having ReactJs, ReactNative and AngularJs for frontend, and Django or flask for backend. I also like to solve DS Algo problems on Hackerrank.
